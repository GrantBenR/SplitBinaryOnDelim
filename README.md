This is a half assed program I made to split the japanese voice acting BIN file of Ys Vi the Ark of Napishtim's Konami PS2 release. It searches for a the series of character VAGp in the binary, finds the associated name of length 16 at an offest of 32 from the VAG header and then splits the file into its constituent parts. 
Evidently, there are some odd voice lines in the package since 8 were missing after running the program, but alas.
This could be considerably more efficient, but I do not care to make it so since odds are it's not gonna see much use.
